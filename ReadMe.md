## Installation

### Requirements
* **Node.js v16+** - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* **NPM v8+** - Node Package Manager is a package manager for Node.js.
* **Git v2+** - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed for speed and data integrity.
* **VPS** - A VPS is a virtual private server. This is where the bot will be hosted

### Setup
* **Install Node.js** - Follow the instructions on the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website.
* **Install NPM** - Follow the instructions on the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) website.
* **Install Git** - Follow the instructions on the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) website.

After Node.js is installed and NPM Verify Their Versions.

```console
foo@bar:~$ node -v # Check Node.js Version (Should be v16+)
v16.15.0 

foo@bar:~$ npm -v # Check NPM Version (Should be 8+)
8.5.5

foo@bar:~$ git -v # Check Git Version (Should be 2+)
2.36.1
```

If your Node.js Version is not v16+ or your NPM Version is not 8+, you will need to update your Node.js and NPM Versions.

Now that you have Node.js and NPM installed, you can install the bot.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Darker-Ink/Pterodactyl-Bot.git # Clone the bot
cd Pterodactyl-Bot # Change to the bot directory
npm install # Install the packages
node . # Run the bot
```
